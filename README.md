# Сайн уу ертөнц / Hello, World! 🌏

I am an emerging software engineer with an interest in AI, Data Analysis and Development. I am dedicated to continuously expanding my skillset and knowledge in the field of computer science. I am a 2022-2023 scholarhsip recipient of the [Code Like A Girl](https://www.codelikeagirl.com/) and [She Codes Australia Plus Program](https://shecodes.com.au/blog/introducing-the-she-codes-plus-cohort-for-perth-2022-2023/). In addition to my programs, I have a Bachelor of Commerce in Finance and Marketing from The University of Western Australia. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's in Computer Science from Monash University.
